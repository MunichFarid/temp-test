# How to work with Impact Framework
## Installing
Start by installing framework itself:

```sh
npm install -g "@grnsft/if"
```
Then installing some plugins:

```sh
npm install -g "@grnsft/if-plugins"
```

## Testing
First checkout the repository [https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/if], which contains some example files 
```sh
cd if
ie --manifest examples/manifests/sum.yml
```

# Ideas for Hackathon
## Serverless vs server-based computing
- Make a comparison of how much is the carbon footprint of serverless and server-based computing on AWS

## Grafana dashboard
- Showing how much the deployed pods are consuming
